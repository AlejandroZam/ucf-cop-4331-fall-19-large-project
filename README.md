# UCF Dollar Menu

> BTW this currently does not work on heroku, but hopefully will, something wrong with babel-eslint and react-scripts during the build process

## Quick Start

``` bash
# Install dependencies for server
npm install

# Run the client & server with concurrently
npm run dev

# Run the Express server only
npm run server

# Run the React client only
npm run client

# Server runs on http://localhost:5000 and client on http://localhost:3000
```
